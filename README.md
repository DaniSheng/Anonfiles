In Guided mode, You will be Guided step by step when uploading the file. Very Begineer Friendly design.
Use without any options `e.g Anonfiles.sh` to use **Guided Mode**.<br>

# Installing
The reason of installing instead of using the standalone is, You can use it anywhere. e.g If you are on the `Desktop` directory. The executable will start on the same directory. Even the *Guided Mode* will become a lot easier. You will need to put absolute path on the standalone executable.
